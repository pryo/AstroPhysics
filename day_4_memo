Day 4 memo

The slides from M.Strauss made some statements that I need to understand. Following questions need to be answered:
At page 2:
1 "SDSS data are organized into plates" and the plate organization seems has something to do with exposure time.
plate is one metal plate drilled with optical fiber holes corresponding object spatial projection. Each plate were used in one pointing.
2 what is fiber number?
It's the sequence number for fiber on a plate, corresponding an object.

3 what does pointing means?
The orientation of the telescope.

4 what is the noise and how does noise present itself in the flux values?
The noise is there indicated by S/N, and cannot be easily seperated.
At page 5:

5 Is best fit model refer to certain spectrum pattern of elements?


6 what is mask bits regarding spectra?
each bit has specific binary scientific meaning.

At page 6:
7 What resulted the difference on S/N between PFS galactic archeology	spectra galaxy, evolution	spectra and cosmology	spectra?

8 What are the benefit to zoom into lyman alpha emission line?

9 how do we define one exposure in PFS spectra?
