1 "SDSS data are organized into plates" and the plate organization seems has something to do with exposure time.

2 what is fiber number?

3 what does pointing means?

4 what is the noise and how does noise present itself in the flux values?

At page 5:

5 Is best fit model refer to certain spectrum pattern of elements?

6 what is mask bits regarding spectra?

At page 6:
7 What resulted the difference on S/N between PFS galactic archeology	spectra galaxy, evolution	spectra and cosmology	spectra?

8 What are the benifit to zoom into lyman alpha emission line?
