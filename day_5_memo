Astronomical spectroscopy general study
The major bands of spectroscopy are radio, x-ray, visible spectrum.
The atmosphere opacity regarding different wavelength varies, only radio wave and visible wave are observable from earth surface, others will have to rely on satellite.

To understand in depth how the signal was collected and processed, we need to understand and explain following term:

angular resolution: theta = 1.22 * lambda/ D
theta is resolution in radians , lambda is wavelength of radio signal and D is the diameter if the lens aperture

astronomical interferometer: an array of telescopes or antennas work as a single device to provide image with higher angular resolution. In radio telescope the combining technology is aperture synthesis.

The Astronomical spectroscopy can be used to study the chemical properties of star.

Presumably hot solid star emit continuous spectrum while hot gas only emit lights at certain band. So suns which is a hot solid surround by cooler gas will present absorption lines, comparing with know gas absorption line, we can acquire the composition of suns.

With black body theory establishing relationship between the temperature and peak emission wavelength as:

lambda*T =b

where lambda is peak wavelength, T is temperature, b is black body constant, We can determine the temperature from spectra.

In the study of galaxy, spectra was used to find quasars and dark matter by red/blue shift of galaxies presented in spectra.

People also study interstellar medium with spectra, which is called nebulae, absorption, reflection and emission type was defined.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_spectroscopy#Interstellar_medium The detailed explanation of discovery history can be found here.

Next week, I will look into coaddition and PFS specific spectra data.
